## Technology Stack

### Prettier Configuration

```json
{
  "printWidth": 140,
  "semi": true,
  "tabWidth": 4,
  "bracketSpacing": true,
  "arrowParens": "always",
  "trailingComma": "none"
}
```

## Testing Patterns

- Write tests using Vitest
- Aim for good test coverage but focus on critical paths
- Test error scenarios and edge cases

## Performance Considerations

## Development Workflow

- Use `npm run build` to build for production
- Use `npm run test` to run tests with coverage, but since we have so many test cases, run tests only related to the current changes
- Use `npm run lint` to check code quality
